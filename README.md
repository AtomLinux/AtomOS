# Cosmos Linux
The Linux Distribution for Beginners.
This OS is based on Ubuntu 22.04 and uses the KDE Plasma Desktop.
It is free and open source. All of the Ubuntu bloat like snap has been replaced or removed. (Snap is replaced with Flatpak).


Just a quick note here: Please give me time to create this as I am very busy at the moment but I hope to release a Public Beta in July 2024.
